            I have just experienced a tour in a remote area named <b>Sitakundu</b>. The place is really really amazing . Mohamaya Lake is a beautiful artificial lake located in Mirsharai Upazila of Chattogram, Bangladesh. It is the second largest man-made lake in the country, created by constructing a rubber dam. The lake was officially inaugurated in 2010 and serves both irrigation and recreational purposes. Surrounded by green hills and natural waterfalls, the lake offers a serene and scenic environment that attracts many visitors throughout the year. It has become a popular spot for kayaking, boating, and camping. The clear blue water and peaceful atmosphere make it ideal for picnics and nature outings. Local and international tourists often come here to enjoy the beauty of nature, especially during the winter season. There are also caves and hiking trails around the lake, which add to its adventure appeal. Access to the lake is easy from Dhaka and Chattogram by road or rail. Though tourism facilities are still developing, Mohamaya Lake remains a quiet and charming place for families and nature lovers. Its calm waters, greenery, and refreshing environment make it a hidden gem in the Chattogram region. With ongoing development plans, Mohamaya Lake is expected to become one of the leading eco-tourism destinations in Bangladesh.
